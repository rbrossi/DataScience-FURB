We provide you with updates of the Institute\\'s \\ncurrent research publications, events and media programs.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIN THIS WEEK\\'S ISSUE:\\n1. Pentagon \"Shocked\" to Find Rivers Dammed with Pork\\n2. The Environmental Propaganda Agency\\n3. William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPENTAGON \"SHOCKED\" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK\\n\\nCaptain Louis Renault -- Claude Raines\\'s cheerfully duplicitous character in \\nthe 1942 film classic \"Casablanca\" -- asserted glibly that he was \"shocked, \\nshocked\" to learn that gambling was taking place at Rick\\'s Cafe. Moments \\nlater he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night.\\n\\nAll this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in \\nmilitary construction. The investigation concluded that three senior Army \\nCorps of Engineers officials had, just as one whistle-blowing Corps economist \\nhad claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington \\nPost called \"a billion-dollar construction binge on the Mississippi and \\nIllinois rivers.\"\\n\\n\"The [Pentagon] investigators concluded that the agency\\'s aggressive efforts \\nto expand its budget and missions, as well as its eagerness to please its \\ncorporate customers and congressional patrons, have helped \\'create an \\natmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy,\\'\" the \\nPost reports.\\n\\n\"Even the agency\\'s retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were \\noften \\'corrupt,\\' and that several Corps employees cited \\'immense pressure\\' to \\ngreen-light questionable projects.\"\\n\\nBureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy. But they \\nare hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five \\nYear Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems that \\nevery few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own \\ncentrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under \\nthe same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.\\n\\nWith corruption and waste seemingly \"taken care of,\" the worst pork-barrel \\nspenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook, only to \\nenjoy -- like Casablanca\\'s Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the \\nbeginnings of a beautiful new friendship.\\n\\nFor the Washington Post series on the Army Corp of Engineers boondoggle, see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-1.html.\\n\\nFor a summary of the Independent Institute book, ARMS, POLITICS AND THE \\nECONOMY: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives, edited by Robert Higgs, see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-2.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY\\n\\nWill the neck-to-neck presidential race help reduce -- or intensify -- \\npressure for the next president of the United States to score points with \\nstatist environmental activists?\\n\\nExcept on a few controversial issues, a strong case can be made that the \\nforty-third President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a \\nclose friend of \"the environment.\" President George W. Bush, for example, \\nwould face strong pressure to show that he is \"bipartisan\" in his approach to \\nenvironmental protection; whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to \\nwin back those who supported Nader and the Greens.\\n\\nAll the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current \\napproach to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the \\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms \\nit, the Environmental Propaganda Agency.\\n\\nThe EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis to illustrate \\nits seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it in a highly \\nmisleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean Air Act \\nprograms produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health \\nbenefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE \\nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, \"[The EPA\\'s] study actually represents a milestone in \\nbureaucratic propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study \\nseemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than \\nto come as close as possible to the truth.\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, writes Marxsen, \"Without the illusory benefit of all the lives \\nsaved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably \\ncould have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice. The Clean \\nAir Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air \\npollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the \\nmost sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward \\nin its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane \\ndetermination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.\"\\n\\nFor more information, see \"The Environmental Propaganda Agency,\" by Craig S. \\nMarxsen (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Summer 2000), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-3.html.\\n\\nFor analysis of other EPA programs, see the Independent Institute book, \\nCUTTING GREEN TAPE: Toxic Pollutants, Environmental Regulation and the Law, \\nedited by Richard Stroup and Roger Meiners, at \\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-4.html.\\n\\nFor Robert Formaini\\'s insightful review of Kip Viscusi\\'s important book, \\nRATIONAL RISK POLICY (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Winter 1999), see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-5.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader\\n\\n\"I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this \\nsubject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation.... I \\nwill not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch \\n-- and I will be heard.\"\\n     -- William Lloyd Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831\\n\\nDecember 12 marks the 195th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd \\nGarrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement. As the late \\nhistorian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist \\nbiography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:\\n\\n\"William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a \\nBiblical prophet\\'s power and a propagandist\\'s skill, forced the nation to \\nconfront the most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years \\nhe edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which \\nremains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the \\nservice of civic idealism.\\n\\n\"Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education -- \\nconsidered himself \\'a New England mechanic\\' and lived outside the precincts \\nof the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work \\nof challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous \\nvision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists -- \\nfemale and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement \\nwhich, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of \\nordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who \\nachieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong \\nand then ridiculed as impossible.\"\\n\\nIndeed, without Garrison\\'s inflammatory but compelling writing, speaking and \\norganizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery movement \\nat all.\\n\\nFor more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry Mayer\\'s talk from \\nthe Independent Policy Forum, \"The Civil War: Liberty and American Leviathan\" \\n(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-6.html, or hear it in \\nRealAudio at http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-7.html.\\n\\nAlso see Jeffrey Rogers Hummel\\'s review of Henry Mayer\\'s brilliant biography, \\nALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery (THE \\nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-8.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you enjoy receiving THE LIGHTHOUSE ... please help us support it.\\n\\nYour supporting Independent Associate Membership enables us to reach \\nthousands of other people.

The Cross Border\\n> team provides gray market awareness training to all sales personnel, mail\\n> and phone hotline access to report gray market activity, works jointly\\n> with regional sales, services, business unit and channel teams to create\\n> policy and procedures to reduce gray market activity and, working with the\\n> Law department, to bring legal action against gray market brokers if\\n> warranted.\\n>\\n> As a result of these efforts, Compaq has filed its first lawsuit against\\n> two Canadian technology consulting firms for breach of contract and fraud.\\n> The suit, which seeks compensatory damages of more than $17 million,\\n> claims the consulting firms fraudulently represented to Compaq that they\\n> had a contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation\\'s Federal\\n> Aviation Administration to supply a large number of computers and related\\n> equipment to U.S. airports. This lawsuit hit many national publications\\n> and sends a message to the worldwide gray market community that Compaq\\n> will take actions to protect its authorized resellers, product quality and\\n> our customers.\\n>\\n> For further information on the Cross Border Office, gray market red flags\\n> and to view the web-based training video, see\\n> http://inline.compaq.com/wwsm/crossborder/index.asp\\n>\\n> Key Channel Partner programs rolling out\\n> Early this year the Tigerbite project was established to redefine and\\n> simplify Compaq\\'s model with our channel partners.  A key element of the\\n> model is worldwide programs that provide profitable growth opportunities\\n> for Compaq and its partners.  Two such programs - Internet List Pricing\\n> (ILP) and the Compaq Agent Program - are currently being implemented by\\n> the regions.\\n>\\n> Worldwide implementation of ILP is a top priority for the company.\\n> Creating and publishing (where needed) competitive List Prices is\\n> absolutely essential to establishing a more consistent, worldwide pricing\\n> model for both our customers and partners. By the end of this month ILP\\n> will have been implemented in North America, Latin America, Japan and\\n> Greater China, with pilot programs in Singapore and Malaysia.  EMEA and\\n> the remaining Asia Pacific countries are expected to complete the rollout\\n> by January 1, 2001.\\n>\\n> The Compaq Agent Program, which allows partners to earn commissions when\\n> they refer customers to purchase products/services directly from us,\\n> currently has been implemented in the U.S., Latin America (14 countries)\\n> and CKK.  This month, APD is implementing pilot programs in Singapore and\\n> Malaysia, and plans to roll out the program in seven additional countries\\n> in the first quarter.

Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.\\nPlease, remember to vote and go early, polls open at\\n7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put\\nit off until 7pm as there could be lines and the\\nsupervisors are not required to keep the polls open\\nafter 7pm for those in line.\\nRemind your friends and family to vote and if someone\\nneeds transportation to the polls, give them a ride or\\ncall your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or\\nyour local Democratic campaign office, they will have\\npeople available to transport people to the polls.\\nKeep an eye out while you are at the polls for\\nelectoral fraud and report any suspicious activity\\nincluding inappropriate campaigning to the poll\\nwatchers at the polls. The Democrats and the\\nRepublicans will have representatives at most of the\\npolls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.\\nFinally, if you have time, call your local offices and\\noffer your time to make phone calls to encourage\\npeople to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to\\nbe available to help prevent of voter fraud.\\n\\nFinally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come\\nin. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!\\n\\nJust one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's\\nfrom me and everyone else)!\\nTake care and VOTE!\\nLiz\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nThousands of Stores.

We\\'ve\\n> already reported a number of major wins as a result of the joint efforts\\n> by our Sales and Services teams.  There is an air of excitement and\\n> anticipation about Compaq\\'s momentum - I see it in the emails from many of\\n> you and as I meet with our teams and customers around the world.  You\\'re a\\n> remarkable team and, as Michael puts it, let\\'s keep the pedal to the metal\\n> and keep the momentum strong as we work to successfully close 2000!\\n>\\n> Speaking of my travels...\\n> This month I visited Johannesburg, South Africa, Dubai within the United\\n> Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.  All of these countries are part of\\n> EMEA\\'s Business Development Group (BDG), which is responsible for\\n> developing Compaq business in 98 countries. The group is focused on both\\n> developed and emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and\\n> Africa. Over the past six years, BDG has grown its revenue more than\\n> 10-fold.\\n>\\n> In South Africa I visited Vodacom, which with 4 million subscribers, is\\n> Africa\\'s largest mobile phone network operator.  The company has just\\n> upgraded its billing systems to handle further expansion, and to date is\\n> one of the world\\'s largest Wildfire installations with some 21 AlphaServer\\n> GS systems.  I also spent time with the management of Mobile Telephone\\n> Networks (MTN), South Africa\\'s #2 cellphone operator and another big\\n> Wildfire customer.  In fact, we just got word that they\\'ve placed a $10M\\n> order for four GS320 AlphaServer systems and storage.\\n>\\n> One of my more interesting activities while there was learning more about\\n> Ikageng, a Compaq-led initiative to bring the benefits of the information\\n> age to the rural communities of Africa.  Ikageng brings together the\\n> provision of safe drinking water, affordable healthcare, distance\\n> learning, improved subsistence farming techniques and Internet access.\\n> All of this is co-funded by a community bank, together with Compaq,\\n> Johnnic, a South African media and information group, and the active\\n> participation of the World Bank.  A real example of Inspiration Technology\\n> at work!\\n>\\n> My visit to the United Arab Emirates included a dinner with our top 30\\n> customers from across the region, a VIP lunch with our top partners, as\\n> well as meetings with employees in the region.  I also attended Gitex, the\\n> region\\'s largest IT exhibition, and met with press at that event to convey\\n> Compaq\\'s commitment to the UAE.  I was also privileged to have a personal\\n> meeting with His Highness Sheik Mohamad bin Rashid al Maktoum, Crown\\n> Prince of Dubai and the Minister of Defense.  These meetings were around\\n> the official opening of Dubai Internet City, an area of Dubai dedicated to\\n> making the city the \"Silicon Valley\"  of the Middle East.\\n>\\n> I spent a very interesting day at Aramco in Saudi Arabia, our largest\\n> account in the UAE. We are the ProLiant standard in this very large energy\\n> company and we have a great opportnuity to build a strong partnership\\n> across many additional solutions including high performance technical\\n> computing, ZLE applications and enterprise storage, in addition to\\n> recapturing client business from the competition\\n>\\n> Some of our largest wins this month\\n> * Tokyo Stock Exchange - We are replacing Hitachi at the world\\'s third\\n> largest stock exchange, with a $60-80M order for Himalaya systems.

The centre is the company\\'s first facility to fully display our\\n> unique end-to-end capabilities of  solutions, services and products in the\\n> mobile Internet and wireless space.  The hands-on centre showcases today\\'s\\n> wireless solutions within four environments - car, home, office and public\\n> access areas.  Technologies featured include GSM, GPRS, future 3G\\n> standards, WLAN and Bluetooth.  Compaq\\'s mobile partners such as Nokia,\\n> Oracle, Cisco, Microsoft, Siebel and Ericsson also plan to participate in\\n> the opening.  The centre is already hosting customer visits and will\\n> engage with thousands of customer and partners over the coming year\\n> through a mix of seminars, tours and customized workshops.  For more info,\\n> see  http://inline-se.soo.cpqcorp.net/wireless/\\n>\\n> Planning for Innovate Forum 2001 under way\\n> Compaq\\'s premier event for its global and large account customers -\\n> Innovate Forum 2001 - is set for May 23-24 at the George R. Brown\\n> Convention Center in Houston.  The hand-picked guest list will include\\n> some 4,000-5,000 senior-level technical and business executives, including\\n> our key channel partners, press, industry and financial analysts, and\\n> Compaq\\'s key alliance partners.  The program will feature keynote\\n> speeches, plenary sessions, special interest seminars, a solutions\\n> pavilion, and social events.  For more information, see the Innovate site\\n> on Inline:  http://inline.compaq.com/na/innovate/\\n>\\n> Cross Border Office files first lawsuit\\n> The Cross Border Office has been created to prevent unauthorized movement\\n> of Compaq products by dealers and gray market brokers in order to protect\\n> profit margins and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  The Cross Border\\n> team provides gray market awareness training to all sales personnel, mail\\n> and phone hotline access to report gray market activity, works jointly\\n> with regional sales, services, business unit and channel teams to create\\n> policy and procedures to reduce gray market activity and, working with the\\n> Law department, to bring legal action against gray market brokers if\\n> warranted.\\n>\\n> As a result of these efforts, Compaq has filed its first lawsuit against\\n> two Canadian technology consulting firms for breach of contract and fraud.\\n> The suit, which seeks compensatory damages of more than $17 million,\\n> claims the consulting firms fraudulently represented to Compaq that they\\n> had a contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation\\'s Federal\\n> Aviation Administration to supply a large number of computers and related\\n> equipment to U.S. airports. This lawsuit hit many national publications\\n> and sends a message to the worldwide gray market community that Compaq\\n> will take actions to protect its authorized resellers, product quality and\\n> our customers.\\n>\\n> For further information on the Cross Border Office, gray market red flags\\n> and to view the web-based training video, see\\n> http://inline.compaq.com/wwsm/crossborder/index.asp\\n>\\n> Key Channel Partner programs rolling out\\n> Early this year the Tigerbite project was established to redefine and\\n> simplify Compaq\\'s model with our channel partners.  A key element of the\\n> model is worldwide programs that provide profitable growth opportunities\\n> for Compaq and its partners.  Two such programs - Internet List Pricing\\n> (ILP) and the Compaq Agent Program - are currently being implemented by\\n> the regions.\\n>\\n> Worldwide implementation of ILP is a top priority for the company.\\n> Creating and publishing (where needed) competitive List Prices is\\n> absolutely essential to establishing a more consistent, worldwide pricing\\n> model for both our customers and partners. By the end of this month ILP\\n> will have been implemented in North America, Latin America, Japan and\\n> Greater China, with pilot programs in Singapore and Malaysia.  EMEA and\\n> the remaining Asia Pacific countries are expected to complete the rollout\\n> by January 1, 2001.\\n>\\n> The Compaq Agent Program, which allows partners to earn commissions when\\n> they refer customers to purchase products/services directly from us,\\n> currently has been implemented in the U.S., Latin America (14 countries)\\n> and CKK.  This month, APD is implementing pilot programs in Singapore and\\n> Malaysia, and plans to roll out the program in seven additional countries\\n> in the first quarter.  EMEA held an Agent Program Summit this month with\\n> 10 countries to assess and develop their 2001 rollout plans which include\\n> adding Enterprise-class products to their program next year.\\n>\\n> News from the Compaq Alliances team\\n> *      Compaq regained the #1 platform partner position with SAP with 33%\\n> market share over all platforms (NT, UNIX with R/3, and mySAP.com). IBM is\\n> 2nd in line with 23% share. In North America alone, our overall SAP share\\n> increased from 25% to 32% in the third quarter.  As an aside, SAP\\'s entire\\n> executive board and senior executive staff use our iPAQ Pocket PCs.\\n> Rollout of the product to SAP Sales and Marketing is also in progress -- a\\n> very visible endorsement of Compaq\\'s leadership in Internet access as it\\n> applies to enterprise applications.\\n> * Cable & Wireless CEO and executive visit to Marlboro in October\\n> included CEO Graham Wallace and 56 top C&W executives. C&W new ASP\\n> \\'a-Services\\' UK launch on October 31 followed the successful U.S. launch\\n> in late September.\\n> * Compaq secured the notebook business with CGE&Y UK for their\\n> internal use.

Pentagon \"Shocked\" to Find Rivers Dammed with Pork\\n2. The Environmental Propaganda Agency\\n3. William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPENTAGON \"SHOCKED\" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK\\n\\nCaptain Louis Renault -- Claude Raines\\'s cheerfully duplicitous character in \\nthe 1942 film classic \"Casablanca\" -- asserted glibly that he was \"shocked, \\nshocked\" to learn that gambling was taking place at Rick\\'s Cafe. Moments \\nlater he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night.\\n\\nAll this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in \\nmilitary construction. The investigation concluded that three senior Army \\nCorps of Engineers officials had, just as one whistle-blowing Corps economist \\nhad claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington \\nPost called \"a billion-dollar construction binge on the Mississippi and \\nIllinois rivers.\"\\n\\n\"The [Pentagon] investigators concluded that the agency\\'s aggressive efforts \\nto expand its budget and missions, as well as its eagerness to please its \\ncorporate customers and congressional patrons, have helped \\'create an \\natmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy,\\'\" the \\nPost reports.\\n\\n\"Even the agency\\'s retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were \\noften \\'corrupt,\\' and that several Corps employees cited \\'immense pressure\\' to \\ngreen-light questionable projects.\"\\n\\nBureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy. But they \\nare hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five \\nYear Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems that \\nevery few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own \\ncentrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under \\nthe same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.\\n\\nWith corruption and waste seemingly \"taken care of,\" the worst pork-barrel \\nspenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook, only to \\nenjoy -- like Casablanca\\'s Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the \\nbeginnings of a beautiful new friendship.\\n\\nFor the Washington Post series on the Army Corp of Engineers boondoggle, see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-1.html.\\n\\nFor a summary of the Independent Institute book, ARMS, POLITICS AND THE \\nECONOMY: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives, edited by Robert Higgs, see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-2.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY\\n\\nWill the neck-to-neck presidential race help reduce -- or intensify -- \\npressure for the next president of the United States to score points with \\nstatist environmental activists?\\n\\nExcept on a few controversial issues, a strong case can be made that the \\nforty-third President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a \\nclose friend of \"the environment.\" President George W. Bush, for example, \\nwould face strong pressure to show that he is \"bipartisan\" in his approach to \\nenvironmental protection; whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to \\nwin back those who supported Nader and the Greens.\\n\\nAll the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current \\napproach to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the \\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms \\nit, the Environmental Propaganda Agency.\\n\\nThe EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis to illustrate \\nits seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it in a highly \\nmisleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean Air Act \\nprograms produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health \\nbenefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE \\nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, \"[The EPA\\'s] study actually represents a milestone in \\nbureaucratic propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study \\nseemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than \\nto come as close as possible to the truth.\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, writes Marxsen, \"Without the illusory benefit of all the lives \\nsaved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably \\ncould have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice. The Clean \\nAir Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air \\npollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the \\nmost sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward \\nin its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane \\ndetermination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.\"\\n\\nFor more information, see \"The Environmental Propaganda Agency,\" by Craig S. \\nMarxsen (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Summer 2000), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-3.html.\\n\\nFor analysis of other EPA programs, see the Independent Institute book, \\nCUTTING GREEN TAPE: Toxic Pollutants, Environmental Regulation and the Law, \\nedited by Richard Stroup and Roger Meiners, at \\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-4.html.\\n\\nFor Robert Formaini\\'s insightful review of Kip Viscusi\\'s important book, \\nRATIONAL RISK POLICY (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Winter 1999), see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-5.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader\\n\\n\"I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this \\nsubject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation.... I \\nwill not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch \\n-- and I will be heard.\"\\n     -- William Lloyd Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831\\n\\nDecember 12 marks the 195th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd \\nGarrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement. As the late \\nhistorian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist \\nbiography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:\\n\\n\"William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a \\nBiblical prophet\\'s power and a propagandist\\'s skill, forced the nation to \\nconfront the most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years \\nhe edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which \\nremains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the \\nservice of civic idealism.\\n\\n\"Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education -- \\nconsidered himself \\'a New England mechanic\\' and lived outside the precincts \\nof the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work \\nof challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous \\nvision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists -- \\nfemale and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement \\nwhich, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of \\nordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who \\nachieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong \\nand then ridiculed as impossible.\"\\n\\nIndeed, without Garrison\\'s inflammatory but compelling writing, speaking and \\norganizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery movement \\nat all.\\n\\nFor more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry Mayer\\'s talk from \\nthe Independent Policy Forum, \"The Civil War: Liberty and American Leviathan\" \\n(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-6.html, or hear it in \\nRealAudio at http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-7.html.\\n\\nAlso see Jeffrey Rogers Hummel\\'s review of Henry Mayer\\'s brilliant biography, \\nALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery (THE \\nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-8.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you enjoy receiving THE LIGHTHOUSE ... please help us support it.\\n\\nYour supporting Independent Associate Membership enables us to reach \\nthousands of other people.

Now it ha=\\ns a crisis.=20\\nFORTUNE\\nMonday, January 7, 2002=20\\nWhere were the auditors? People ask that question after every corporate col=\\nlapse, and lately they\\'ve been asking it with disturbing frequency. At Wast=\\ne Management, Sunbeam, Rite Aid, Xerox, and Lucent, major accounting firms =\\neither missed or ignored serious problems. The number of public companies t=\\nhat have corrected or restated earnings since 1998 has doubled to 233, acco=\\nrding to a study by Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Now, followin=\\ng the stunning bankruptcy of Andersen\\'s own client Enron, that question--wh=\\nere were the auditors?--has become a deafening refrain. \"I believe that the=\\nre is a crisis of confidence in my profession,\" Andersen CEO Joseph Berardi=\\nno told a congressional committee investigating Enron\\'s collapse in mid-Dec=\\nember. \"Real change will be required to regain the public trust.\"=20\\nThe full story of the Enron debacle--and what Andersen did or did not do in=\\n its audit--will take months to emerge. In the meantime, no one disagrees w=\\nith Berardino\\'s diagnosis that there\\'s a crisis in accounting--even if his =\\nsudden emphasis on industrywide reform springs from a desire to deflect att=\\nention from Andersen\\'s own culpability. But the kind of \"real change\" requi=\\nred is a matter of substantial debate. The government gave the franchise of=\\n auditing public companies\\' financial statements to the accounting industry=\\n after the 1929 stock market crash. In the decades since, the accountants h=\\nave adroitly avoided significant government regulation by arguing that they=\\n can police themselves. Now, post-Enron, they\\'re doing it again. The Big Fi=\\nve CEOs issued a rare joint statement outlining how they intend to strength=\\nen financial reporting and auditing standards. \"Self-regulation is right fo=\\nr investors, the profession, and the financial markets,\" the release conclu=\\ndes.=20\\nBut is it? Accounting\\'s main self-regulatory body, the Public Oversight Boa=\\nrd, is a monument to the profession\\'s failures. The POB was created in the =\\nlate 1970s, when Congress held hearings on a string of audit failures at pu=\\nblic companies that had--much like the recent rash--shaken confidence in th=\\ne major auditing firms. The POB, which has no enforcement power, investigat=\\nes alleged audit failures and oversees a triennial review process in which =\\nthe major accounting firms examine one another\\'s procedures. And yet proble=\\nms persist; arguably, they have grown more acute. \"Is accounting self-regul=\\nation working? On the face of it, it is not,\" says Representative John Ding=\\nell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who has long sparred with the accountin=\\ng profession.=20\\nIn their defense, the auditors note that current accounting methods, many o=\\nf which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today\\'s compl=\\nex financial transactions. And there is no way, they insist, to prevent sop=\\nhisticated fraud. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (A=\\nICPA), the industry\\'s professional association, points out that accountants=\\n examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they ar=\\ne accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of thos=\\ne few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and =\\nExchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 bill=\\nion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s=\\nince 1995.=20\\nPerhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation\\'s deficiency has been a=\\nccountants\\' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the year=\\ns, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into \"professional =\\nservices\" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi=\\nts from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelt=\\ners, and evaluating their business strategies. In 1999, according to the SE=\\nC, half of the Big Five\\'s revenues came from consulting fees, vs. 13% in 19=\\n81.=20\\nAuditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused o=\\nf using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to s=\\nell more-profitable consulting contracts. \"Audit work is a marvelous market=\\ning tool,\" says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at =\\nColumbia University. \"You are already there doing the audit. You say their =\\ninternal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?\"=\\n But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management =\\n(consulting). \"You cannot serve them both,\" says former SEC commissioner Be=\\nvis Longstreth.=20\\nThis conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 millio=\\nn in auditing fees from Enron last year. That\\'s money Andersen was paid bot=\\nh as Enron\\'s outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as i=\\nts internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo=\\noks and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone =\\nraised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting =\\nfees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. \"If you are au=\\nditing your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them,\" says Ro=\\nbert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin=\\ng profession\\'s recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen h=\\nas not revealed the details of its work on Enron\\'s highly controversial off=\\n-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed c=\\nonsulting fees compromise their objectivity. \"They have militantly refused =\\nto ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem,\" Longstreth says.', 'mid': '30064053.1075860844222.JavaMail.evans@thyme', 'fpath': 'enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/inbox/1014.', 'bcc': [], 'to': ['kenneth.lay@enron.com', 'elizabeth.tilney@enron.com'], 'replyto': None, 'ctype': 'text/plain; charset=us-ascii', 'fname': '1014.', 'date': '2002-01-10 12:10:39-08:00', 'folder': 'inbox', 'subject': 'Accounting Article From Fortune Magazine'} \n",

It frightens me that we are out aski=\\nng customers to let Enron help them \"HEDGE\" their risk when I\\'m not sure En=\\nron\\'s Senior Management understands what a hedge means?\\n\\nI\\'m also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i=\\nn the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse=\\nd in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I=\\n will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the=\\n Natural Gas Business.

I guess we need to have audits performed of Se=\\nnior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as =\\ntheir word?\\n\\nThe fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t=\\nransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and =\\ntook advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin=\\nion is \"CRIMINAL\".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp=\\netrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals=\\n have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne=\\ned to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h=\\naving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders =\\nhave lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we=\\nre hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther =\\ndown the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve=\\nd and to institute criminal charges.  =20\\n\\nI for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.

Schwarzenegger and Riordan have\\nbeen courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.\\n   One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be\\nidentified, said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting\\nparticipants to support Lay\\'s vision and then champion it to officials who\\nare trying to solve the state\\'s energy mess.\\n   PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION\\n   The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is\\nconcerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with\\npower markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government\\nauthority to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last\\nweek to create and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and\\nrun power plants in California.\\n   \"They\\'re trying to rescue deregulation,\" the source said of Enron\\nexecutives. \"They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.\"\\n   At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position\\npaper titled \"Comprehensive Solution for California,\" which was obtained\\nby The Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the\\nbillions in debt incurred by the state\\'s public utilities and that\\ninvestigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are\\nmaking matters worse.\\n   The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway\\nelectricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power\\ngenerators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by\\nregulators and economists.\\n   One of the talking points read: \"Get deregulation right this time --\\nCalifornia needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers.\"\\nAnother point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving\\nelectricity.\\n   INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS\\n   Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and\\nwas an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment\\nwith a competitive power market system.\\n   Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially\\nproduces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from\\ngenerators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this\\nyear, Enron\\'s revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.\\n   Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for\\nEnron, said she would \"look into that\" and then did not return repeated\\ntelephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at\\nthe meeting.\\n   D.C. CONNECTIONS\\n   Meanwhile, Lay\\'s power in Washington is reported to have reached\\nunprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday\\'s New York Times,\\nLay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs\\nregulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story\\nalso said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman\\nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not\\nsupport Lay\\'s desire to further deregulate the nation\\'s electricity\\nsystem. Lay denied the allegation.\\n   Also in attendance at this week\\'s meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief\\nexecutive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of\\nOccidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant\\nAmgen.\\n   Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles\\nLakers star Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton\\nsupporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world\\'s\\nfirst civilian space trip.\\n   Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but\\ndeclined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for\\ncomment through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday\\nafternoon.\\n   A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor\\nattended,\\n   but was \"not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this\\nissue.\\n   His intent is to listen to all sides.\"\\n   Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to\\nDavis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support\\nLay\\'s position and would be willing to sign their names to it.

I met again with Ambassador Blackwill on Tue=\\nsday of this week and gave him a general update on the current status. His =\\nview is that it is very difficult in the post-Sept. 11 environment to get a=\\nnyone in Delhi or Washington to pay attention to economic matters such as D=\\nabhol, but he is trying as best he can. He is meeting with Brajesh Mishra (=\\nPrime Minister\\'s principal secretary) on Saturday, who will have just retur=\\nned from Washington meetings with Ms. Rice, among others, principally to di=\\nscuss anti-terrorist matters.

He says that if Enron receives anything less than its full investment in=\\n DPC, it would amount to an act of expropriation. He further points out tha=\\nt any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms automa=\\ntically faces sanctions from that country. Reportedly, the letter was writt=\\nen three days after the attack on the World Trade Centre. So Mr Lay probabl=\\ny ought to be forgiven for reading more than he should into the \"dead or al=\\nive\" rhetoric of his pal, George W Bush, whose election campaign Mr Lay gen=\\nerously funded. Saner counsel has since prevailed even at the White House; =\\nand far from imposing fresh sanctions, the US government is busy buying sup=\\nport even from countries such as Pakistan by lifting sanctions and offering=\\n a hefty aid package. Enron has never hesitated to use the considerable eco=\\nnomic and political clout of the US government in pushing the Dabhol projec=\\nt at various times. Post September 11, the US government - which is in fact=\\n \\'rewarding\\' Pakistan despite its clearly identified role in funding terror=\\nist groups - ought not to be terrorising India on Enron. Hence, it is entir=\\nely appropriate for the Prime Minister to borrow that little Americanism, r=\\necently made popular by Pervez Musharraf, and ask Kenneth Lay to lay off!\\n\\nInterestingly, Mr Lay\\'s letter apparently makes no mention of several impor=\\ntant facts that will dictate how much India may have to pay Enron. These in=\\nclude the findings of the Madhav Godbole committee report which expose subs=\\ntantial overcharging by DPC on several counts and reveals excess capacity c=\\nreated for port handling and regassification. Moreover, DPC\\'s inability to =\\nramp up the power plant to full contracted capacity within the specified ti=\\nme period has enormous penal provisions attached to it. This serious techni=\\ncal deficiency apart - which alone is grounds enough for repudiating the DP=\\nC contract - the government also has a good case to charge the US company w=\\nith fraud and misrepresentation. The Maharashtra government \\'s judicial inq=\\nuiry only makes India\\'s case stronger.

JENKINS JR.\\n\\nNovember 28, 2001\\nBusiness World\\n\\nBack in the mid-1980s, a pipeline executive called Ken Lay was fishing\\naround for a name for his company, produced by a merger of Houston Natural\\nGas and Omaha-based InterNorth. He consulted with consultants, politicked\\nwith politicians, and came up with a moniker. The company would be called\\n\"Enteron.\"\\n\\nThree weeks later, fed up with the wisecracks from a press that had looked\\nup the dictionary definition of \"enteron\" (n. the intestine), he changed the\\ncompany\\'s name again. Henceforth it would be known as Enron.\\n\\nA columnist less devoted to high standards of decorum might be tempted to\\nextend the metaphor of the company\\'s misbegotten name. In recent weeks,\\nafter all, we\\'ve seen Enron\\'s stock collapse over indigestible accounting\\nand the emergence of dealings between the company and its senior officers\\nthat exude an odor of genuine malfeasance. The evidence is far from clear,\\nbut for the sake of Mr. Lay\\'s reputation one hopes these missteps will prove\\none more case of a company fooling itself rather than setting out\\ndeliberately to defraud the markets.\\n\\nEnron grew to be much more than a pipeline hauler of natural gas, becoming\\nthe pre-eminent trader and marketer of all kinds of energy contracts and a\\nvocal proponent of deregulation. Now, all but overnight, it\\'s kaput, just\\nwaiting to find out if its fate will be bankruptcy or absorption by an\\nerstwhile rival.\\n\\nWe cannot help be put in mind of another commodity wunderkind in the 1970s,\\nPhibro (short for Philipp Brothers). Hard to believe, but Phibro was once a\\nname that made grown men quiver on Wall Street. Fattened by trading profits\\nfrom the great commodity inflation of the 1970s, which some mistook for a\\npermanent new age of scarcity, it scooped up the Street\\'s oldest\\npartnership, Salomon Brothers, tucking it into its back pocket and renaming\\nthe combined firm Phibro-Salomon. Here was a powerhouse of unlimited\\npotential, investors told themselves.\\n\\nFlash ahead to California\\'s electricity meltdown earlier this year. Enron\\nsaw its revenues quadruple partly as a result of the inflated prices being\\nquoted in the California market. Many foresaw a new scarcity megatrend, but\\nthere was no true energy shortage. Posted prices on the California power\\nexchange may have skyrocketed, but the effective price was zero dollars and\\nzero cents, because the utilities had no cash to pay and politicians were\\nthumbing their noses at piles of IOUs.\\n\\nWhen prices are zero, suppliers take a hike -- that\\'s what economics\\nteaches. But once the state government started pumping its own cash into the\\nmarket, the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentiful\\nagain. Now California is swimming in power and nobody talks about an \"energy\\ncrisis\" anymore.\\n\\nYou can date the loss of investor confidence in Enron almost exactly to the\\nmoment when the California fiasco began to repair itself. Fortune Magazine\\nput the inaugural nail in Enron\\'s coffin in March, noting that the company\\'s\\ngrowing dependence on trading had turned it into an oil-patch version of\\nGoldman Sachs. Goldman\\'s stock sells at a price-earnings multiple of 17,\\nreflecting investors\\' well-founded distrust of trading earnings to be\\nreproduced reliably year after year. So why, the magazine asked, was Enron\\nawarded a multiple of 60-plus? Mmm...\\n\\nEnron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation. Boss Ken Lay, a\\nbeliever in technology and the power of markets, was a true visionary, to\\nthe point of annoying people who didn\\'t care for his air of being a man on\\nthe right side of history. The moldering pipeline he took over would\\ncertainly have been an also-ran if he had not thrown Enron headlong into\\ntrading and marketing.\\n\\nBut deregulation doesn\\'t confer permanent advantage on anybody. A\\nderegulated environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsetting\\nof plans and strategies.\\n\\nAdd the fact that, despite the California bubble, there is no reason to\\nbelieve energy prices won\\'t continue their long-term relative decline as\\ntechnology advances more quickly than the depletion of conventional\\nresources. Add also the likelihood that information technology will continue\\nto lower the barriers to entry to Enron\\'s trading business, which means more\\ncompetition and shrinking margins. Enron begins to look a lot like Phibro.\\n\\nThe great commodity-trading machine was already running down by 1981, when\\nit bought Salomon and Wall Street was swooning. Inflation was being quelled\\nby Paul Volcker. The products that Phibro traders bought and sold were\\nincreasingly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges. \"Four or\\nfive years ago, they used to be able to take other companies to the\\ncleaners, because they knew where the market was and others didn\\'t,\" a\\ntrader explained. \"With everyone knowing, within a few cents, where the\\nprice of any product was, Phibro\\'s ability to make a profit off its superior\\nknowledge disappeared.\"\\n\\nNot only is this true of Enron, but of its would-be bottom fisher, Dynegy,\\nrun by Mr. Lay\\'s Houston homeboy, Chuck Watson. Dynegy\\'s proposed takeover\\nof its former nemesis was hanging by a negotiation yesterday.\\n\\nWhile Enron in recent years was selling hard assets and concentrating on\\nelectronic market-making, Mr. Watson was doing the opposite. His big play in\\nthe Enron deal is to get his hands on the original HNG-InterNorth pipeline,\\nnow known as Northern Natural Gas. By having both feet planted in the real\\nbusiness, he claims his firm will be able to make a profitable sideline out\\nof trading despite growing competition and transparency.\\n\\nWe\\'ll see. Dynegy and Enron were born at the same time, and of the same\\nmotive. Dynegy was originally created by six pipeline companies, a\\nWashington law firm and Morgan Stanley to take advantage of new\\nopportunities in deregulated natural gas. But the gnats are already\\ncircling.\\n\\nGas producers who have claimed for years that the duo control too much of\\ntheir fate now insist they shouldn\\'t be allowed to merge. Don\\'t listen to\\nthe fussbudgets. If this was a business in need of trustbusting, Enron\\nwouldn\\'t have been resorting to funny accounting to make its earnings. As\\nMerrill Lynch\\'s Donato Eassey has pointed out, wholesale margins have been\\nsteadily thinning as trading becomes more transparent and competitive.\\n\\nWishful accounting has time and again proved the last refuge of companies\\nwhose dearly held \"visions\" were not panning out. Enron prided itself on\\nbeing realistic and adaptive, but it failed to see that its own beliefs\\nabout the world needed overhauling.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n--------\\n\"It ain\\'t what you don\\'t know that gets you in trouble; it\\'s what you know\\nfor sure that ain\\'t so.\"       -Mark Twain\\n\\nK   A   I   N   O   N      G   R   O   U   P\\nConsulting  +  Staffing  +  Recruiting', 'mid': '29221017.1075860836207.JavaMail.evans@thyme', 'fpath': 'enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/inbox/702.', 'bcc': [], 'to': ['kenneth_lay@enron.com'], 'replyto': None, 'ctype': 'text/plain; charset=us-ascii', 'fname': '702.', 'date': '2001-11-28 09:52:46-08:00', 'folder': 'inbox', 'subject': 'Enron Is History, Says History per the WSJ Page A19'} \n",

I\\'m also excited about Bo McBee and his\\n> worldwide team in Corporate Quality and Customer Satisfaction officially\\n> joining our organization.  He and his team are doing a great job, and\\n> together we will further our efforts to become the leader throughout the\\n> world in satisfying our customers.\\n>\\n> Most of all, I am extremely pleased and encouraged because I believe these\\n> changes confirm the great work you have accomplished this year.  We\\'ve\\n> already reported a number of major wins as a result of the joint efforts\\n> by our Sales and Services teams.  There is an air of excitement and\\n> anticipation about Compaq\\'s momentum - I see it in the emails from many of\\n> you and as I meet with our teams and customers around the world.  You\\'re a\\n> remarkable team and, as Michael puts it, let\\'s keep the pedal to the metal\\n> and keep the momentum strong as we work to successfully close 2000!\\n>\\n> Speaking of my travels...\\n> This month I visited Johannesburg, South Africa, Dubai within the United\\n> Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.  All of these countries are part of\\n> EMEA\\'s Business Development Group (BDG), which is responsible for\\n> developing Compaq business in 98 countries. The group is focused on both\\n> developed and emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and\\n> Africa. Over the past six years, BDG has grown its revenue more than\\n> 10-fold.\\n>\\n> In South Africa I visited Vodacom, which with 4 million subscribers, is\\n> Africa\\'s largest mobile phone network operator.  The company has just\\n> upgraded its billing systems to handle further expansion, and to date is\\n> one of the world\\'s largest Wildfire installations with some 21 AlphaServer\\n> GS systems.  I also spent time with the management of Mobile Telephone\\n> Networks (MTN), South Africa\\'s #2 cellphone operator and another big\\n> Wildfire customer.  In fact, we just got word that they\\'ve placed a $10M\\n> order for four GS320 AlphaServer systems and storage.\\n>\\n> One of my more interesting activities while there was learning more about\\n> Ikageng, a Compaq-led initiative to bring the benefits of the information\\n> age to the rural communities of Africa.  Ikageng brings together the\\n> provision of safe drinking water, affordable healthcare, distance\\n> learning, improved subsistence farming techniques and Internet access.\\n> All of this is co-funded by a community bank, together with Compaq,\\n> Johnnic, a South African media and information group, and the active\\n> participation of the World Bank.  A real example of Inspiration Technology\\n> at work!\\n>\\n> My visit to the United Arab Emirates included a dinner with our top 30\\n> customers from across the region, a VIP lunch with our top partners, as\\n> well as meetings with employees in the region.  I also attended Gitex, the\\n> region\\'s largest IT exhibition, and met with press at that event to convey\\n> Compaq\\'s commitment to the UAE.  I was also privileged to have a personal\\n> meeting with His Highness Sheik Mohamad bin Rashid al Maktoum, Crown\\n> Prince of Dubai and the Minister of Defense.  These meetings were around\\n> the official opening of Dubai Internet City, an area of Dubai dedicated to\\n> making the city the \"Silicon Valley\"  of the Middle East.\\n>\\n> I spent a very interesting day at Aramco in Saudi Arabia, our largest\\n> account in the UAE. We are the ProLiant standard in this very large energy\\n> company and we have a great opportnuity to build a strong partnership\\n> across many additional solutions including high performance technical\\n> computing, ZLE applications and enterprise storage, in addition to\\n> recapturing client business from the competition\\n>\\n> Some of our largest wins this month\\n> * Tokyo Stock Exchange - We are replacing Hitachi at the world\\'s third\\n> largest stock exchange, with a $60-80M order for Himalaya systems.

The centre is the company\\'s first facility to fully display our\\n> unique end-to-end capabilities of  solutions, services and products in the\\n> mobile Internet and wireless space.  The hands-on centre showcases today\\'s\\n> wireless solutions within four environments - car, home, office and public\\n> access areas.  Technologies featured include GSM, GPRS, future 3G\\n> standards, WLAN and Bluetooth.  Compaq\\'s mobile partners such as Nokia,\\n> Oracle, Cisco, Microsoft, Siebel and Ericsson also plan to participate in\\n> the opening.  The centre is already hosting customer visits and will\\n> engage with thousands of customer and partners over the coming year\\n> through a mix of seminars, tours and customized workshops.  For more info,\\n> see  http://inline-se.soo.cpqcorp.net/wireless/\\n>\\n> Planning for Innovate Forum 2001 under way\\n> Compaq\\'s premier event for its global and large account customers -\\n> Innovate Forum 2001 - is set for May 23-24 at the George R. Brown\\n> Convention Center in Houston.  The hand-picked guest list will include\\n> some 4,000-5,000 senior-level technical and business executives, including\\n> our key channel partners, press, industry and financial analysts, and\\n> Compaq\\'s key alliance partners.  The program will feature keynote\\n> speeches, plenary sessions, special interest seminars, a solutions\\n> pavilion, and social events.  For more information, see the Innovate site\\n> on Inline:  http://inline.compaq.com/na/innovate/\\n>\\n> Cross Border Office files first lawsuit\\n> The Cross Border Office has been created to prevent unauthorized movement\\n> of Compaq products by dealers and gray market brokers in order to protect\\n> profit margins and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  The Cross Border\\n> team provides gray market awareness training to all sales personnel, mail\\n> and phone hotline access to report gray market activity, works jointly\\n> with regional sales, services, business unit and channel teams to create\\n> policy and procedures to reduce gray market activity and, working with the\\n> Law department, to bring legal action against gray market brokers if\\n> warranted.\\n>\\n> As a result of these efforts, Compaq has filed its first lawsuit against\\n> two Canadian technology consulting firms for breach of contract and fraud.\\n> The suit, which seeks compensatory damages of more than $17 million,\\n> claims the consulting firms fraudulently represented to Compaq that they\\n> had a contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation\\'s Federal\\n> Aviation Administration to supply a large number of computers and related\\n> equipment to U.S. airports. This lawsuit hit many national publications\\n> and sends a message to the worldwide gray market community that Compaq\\n> will take actions to protect its authorized resellers, product quality and\\n> our customers.\\n>\\n> For further information on the Cross Border Office, gray market red flags\\n> and to view the web-based training video, see\\n> http://inline.compaq.com/wwsm/crossborder/index.asp\\n>\\n> Key Channel Partner programs rolling out\\n> Early this year the Tigerbite project was established to redefine and\\n> simplify Compaq\\'s model with our channel partners.  A key element of the\\n> model is worldwide programs that provide profitable growth opportunities\\n> for Compaq and its partners.  Two such programs - Internet List Pricing\\n> (ILP) and the Compaq Agent Program - are currently being implemented by\\n> the regions.\\n>\\n> Worldwide implementation of ILP is a top priority for the company.\\n> Creating and publishing (where needed) competitive List Prices is\\n> absolutely essential to establishing a more consistent, worldwide pricing\\n> model for both our customers and partners. By the end of this month ILP\\n> will have been implemented in North America, Latin America, Japan and\\n> Greater China, with pilot programs in Singapore and Malaysia.  EMEA and\\n> the remaining Asia Pacific countries are expected to complete the rollout\\n> by January 1, 2001.\\n>\\n> The Compaq Agent Program, which allows partners to earn commissions when\\n> they refer customers to purchase products/services directly from us,\\n> currently has been implemented in the U.S., Latin America (14 countries)\\n> and CKK.  This month, APD is implementing pilot programs in Singapore and\\n> Malaysia, and plans to roll out the program in seven additional countries\\n> in the first quarter.  EMEA held an Agent Program Summit this month with\\n> 10 countries to assess and develop their 2001 rollout plans which include\\n> adding Enterprise-class products to their program next year.\\n>\\n> News from the Compaq Alliances team\\n> *      Compaq regained the #1 platform partner position with SAP with 33%\\n> market share over all platforms (NT, UNIX with R/3, and mySAP.com). IBM is\\n> 2nd in line with 23% share. In North America alone, our overall SAP share\\n> increased from 25% to 32% in the third quarter.  As an aside, SAP\\'s entire\\n> executive board and senior executive staff use our iPAQ Pocket PCs.\\n> Rollout of the product to SAP Sales and Marketing is also in progress -- a\\n> very visible endorsement of Compaq\\'s leadership in Internet access as it\\n> applies to enterprise applications.\\n> * Cable & Wireless CEO and executive visit to Marlboro in October\\n> included CEO Graham Wallace and 56 top C&W executives.

William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPENTAGON \"SHOCKED\" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK\\n\\nCaptain Louis Renault -- Claude Raines\\'s cheerfully duplicitous character in \\nthe 1942 film classic \"Casablanca\" -- asserted glibly that he was \"shocked, \\nshocked\" to learn that gambling was taking place at Rick\\'s Cafe. Moments \\nlater he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night.\\n\\nAll this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in \\nmilitary construction. The investigation concluded that three senior Army \\nCorps of Engineers officials had, just as one whistle-blowing Corps economist \\nhad claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington \\nPost called \"a billion-dollar construction binge on the Mississippi and \\nIllinois rivers.\"\\n\\n\"The [Pentagon] investigators concluded that the agency\\'s aggressive efforts \\nto expand its budget and missions, as well as its eagerness to please its \\ncorporate customers and congressional patrons, have helped \\'create an \\natmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy,\\'\" the \\nPost reports.\\n\\n\"Even the agency\\'s retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were \\noften \\'corrupt,\\' and that several Corps employees cited \\'immense pressure\\' to \\ngreen-light questionable projects.\"\\n\\nBureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy. But they \\nare hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five \\nYear Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems that \\nevery few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own \\ncentrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under \\nthe same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.\\n\\nWith corruption and waste seemingly \"taken care of,\" the worst pork-barrel \\nspenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook, only to \\nenjoy -- like Casablanca\\'s Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the \\nbeginnings of a beautiful new friendship.\\n\\nFor the Washington Post series on the Army Corp of Engineers boondoggle, see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-1.html.\\n\\nFor a summary of the Independent Institute book, ARMS, POLITICS AND THE \\nECONOMY: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives, edited by Robert Higgs, see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-2.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY\\n\\nWill the neck-to-neck presidential race help reduce -- or intensify -- \\npressure for the next president of the United States to score points with \\nstatist environmental activists?\\n\\nExcept on a few controversial issues, a strong case can be made that the \\nforty-third President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a \\nclose friend of \"the environment.\" President George W. Bush, for example, \\nwould face strong pressure to show that he is \"bipartisan\" in his approach to \\nenvironmental protection; whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to \\nwin back those who supported Nader and the Greens.\\n\\nAll the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current \\napproach to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the \\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms \\nit, the Environmental Propaganda Agency.\\n\\nThe EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis to illustrate \\nits seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it in a highly \\nmisleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean Air Act \\nprograms produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health \\nbenefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE \\nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, \"[The EPA\\'s] study actually represents a milestone in \\nbureaucratic propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study \\nseemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than \\nto come as close as possible to the truth.\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, writes Marxsen, \"Without the illusory benefit of all the lives \\nsaved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably \\ncould have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice. The Clean \\nAir Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air \\npollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the \\nmost sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward \\nin its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane \\ndetermination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.\"\\n\\nFor more information, see \"The Environmental Propaganda Agency,\" by Craig S. \\nMarxsen (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Summer 2000), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-3.html.\\n\\nFor analysis of other EPA programs, see the Independent Institute book, \\nCUTTING GREEN TAPE: Toxic Pollutants, Environmental Regulation and the Law, \\nedited by Richard Stroup and Roger Meiners, at \\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-4.html.\\n\\nFor Robert Formaini\\'s insightful review of Kip Viscusi\\'s important book, \\nRATIONAL RISK POLICY (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Winter 1999), see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-5.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader\\n\\n\"I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this \\nsubject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation.... I \\nwill not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch \\n-- and I will be heard.\"\\n     -- William Lloyd Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831\\n\\nDecember 12 marks the 195th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd \\nGarrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement. As the late \\nhistorian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist \\nbiography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:\\n\\n\"William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a \\nBiblical prophet\\'s power and a propagandist\\'s skill, forced the nation to \\nconfront the most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years \\nhe edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which \\nremains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the \\nservice of civic idealism.\\n\\n\"Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education -- \\nconsidered himself \\'a New England mechanic\\' and lived outside the precincts \\nof the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work \\nof challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous \\nvision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists -- \\nfemale and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement \\nwhich, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of \\nordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who \\nachieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong \\nand then ridiculed as impossible.\"\\n\\nIndeed, without Garrison\\'s inflammatory but compelling writing, speaking and \\norganizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery movement \\nat all.\\n\\nFor more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry Mayer\\'s talk from \\nthe Independent Policy Forum, \"The Civil War: Liberty and American Leviathan\" \\n(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-6.html, or hear it in \\nRealAudio at http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-7.html.\\n\\nAlso see Jeffrey Rogers Hummel\\'s review of Henry Mayer\\'s brilliant biography, \\nALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery (THE \\nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-8.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you enjoy receiving THE LIGHTHOUSE ... please help us support it.\\n\\nYour supporting Independent Associate Membership enables us to reach \\nthousands of other people.
